 just C with some stuff would be enough, for me and my shitcodes at least

 CXT [pron. sixty] (C-eXTension)
   an extension for C programming language (C) R.I.P. Dennis M. Ritchie
   from C++ (simple func/struct templates, function members (constructor/destructor), single inheritance)
   and a better standard library (containers, string/IO formatting, type-traits, etc).

   Why ? I'm not smart enough for optimize coding in C++ and dealing with its complexity,
   I feel comfortable with C but it was lack of some features, so I added them into this code generator.
   a simple build system will handle compile things until binary file is created.

   Build system config file with .cxtconf postfix contains compile/link stuff like C compiler/linker binary path
   and their options. source file will contains row C code and this extension features
   main.cxt in conf file -> cxt Program.cxtconf -> main.c -> gcc main.c (options in conf file)
